# 🍳 SousChef — Smart Recipe Navigator

SousChef is a lightweight Android cooking assistant that helps users follow recipes step-by-step without losing track.
It focuses on speed, clarity, and offline usability rather than being a heavy recipe management app.

Recipes are stored locally in JSON, navigated using a custom doubly linked list, and enhanced with smart timers, scaling, and unit conversion.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Add and save recipes locally
- 📂 Load recipes instantly
- 🧭 Step-by-step navigation
- ⏱️ Built-in cooking timer with looping alarm
- 🔢 Fixed multipliers (1×, 2×, 3×…)
- 🌍 UK ↔ US unit conversion toggle
- 🗑️ Swipe-to-delete recipes
- 📊 Progress tracking
- 📶 Fully offline

## 🧠 How It Works

SousChef uses a custom Doubly Linked List (DLL) to manage recipe steps efficiently.

Why DLL?

- O(1) next/previous navigation
- Memory-efficient step traversal
- Perfect for guided cooking flows
